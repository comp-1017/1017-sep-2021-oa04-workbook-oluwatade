    <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line in 
        your displayed web page on the browser. The browser does not display your
        context in the physical style of how you have entered your code in your 
        html file.
    </p>
    <p> This is my second paragraph on the displayed browser page. It will start a 
        new line.
    </p>
